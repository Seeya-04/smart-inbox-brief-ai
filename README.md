Smart Inbox Brief AI

Smart Inbox Brief AI is an intelligent email assistant that automatically fetches, summarizes, prioritizes, and analyzes emails. It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP), Sentiment Analysis, Reinforcement Learning, and Visualization tools to provide users with a concise and prioritized view of their inbox.

🚀 Features

Email Fetching & Setup: Securely fetches emails using stored credentials.

Summarization: Extracts concise summaries of long emails.

Priority Scoring: Ranks emails based on importance using a reinforcement learning model.

Sentiment Analysis: Detects the sentiment of incoming emails (positive, negative, neutral).

Smart Suggestions: Recommends actions and tags for incoming emails.

Interactive Dashboard: Streamlit-powered UI to view, search, and manage emails.

Smart Brief (Demo App): Lightweight demo (demo_streamlit_app.py) that showcases email briefing and summarization.

Feedback System: Users can provide feedback to improve prioritization and tagging.

Text-to-Speech (TTS): Converts important emails into speech for accessibility.

Visual Analytics: Graphical insights into email trends, priorities, and feedback.
